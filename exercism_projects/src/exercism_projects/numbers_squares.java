/**
 * Find the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares of the first N natural numbers.
 * 
 * The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is (1 + 2 + ... + 10) = 55 = 3025.
 * The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is 1 + 2 + ... + 10 = 385.
 * 
 * Hence the difference between the square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers and the sum of the squares of the 
 * first ten natural numbers is 3025 - 385 = 2640.
 * 
 * You are not expected to discover an efficient solution to this yourself from first principles; research is allowed, indeed, encouraged. 
 * Finding the best algorithm for the problem is a key skill in software engineering.
